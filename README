One Ring - Scripting Rules Engine Service

    One Ring isn't like other "Rules Engines", it's meant to be used as a web service for multiple applications
    to gain access to scripted processing of arbitrary parameters.

    It centralises storage and processing of common rules (or business rules) for multiple applications that need
    access to the same rules. Rules are defined using a simple language understandable by domain experts.

    One Ring is aimed at continuous processing for multiple small applications, not batch processing of billions of
    entities. It is very light weight and is deployed as a WAR inside a container like Tomcat. For processing purposes
    there is no reason why you can't have multiple One Ring servers running from the same Database.

    It has not been optimised for speed, it's not fast but it's not exactly slow.
